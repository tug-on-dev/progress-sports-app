# Phase 1 : Inspect and Document

Look at all the project #codebase :


- Inspect the code and document it using UML, Sequence diagrams, Class diagrams, and other relevant diagrams using Mermaid syntax.
- Create or update the documentation files in the appropriate subfolder.
- Identify all the Functional Requirements addressed by the code, and document them as MOSCOW requirements.
- Identify all the Non-Functional Requirements addressed by the code, and document them.
- Identify all the Deployment scenarios addressed by the code, and document them.
- Identify all the Usability features addressed by the code, and document them.

- When you write functional requirements, use the following format:
  - **Requirement**: Short description
  - **Priority**: Must have / Should have / Could have / Won't have
  - **Rationale**: Why is this requirement important?
  - **Source**: Which part of the code addresses this requirement?
- When you write non-functional requirements, use the following format:
  - **Requirement**: Short description
  - **Category**: Performance / Security / Scalability / Maintainability / Usability
  - **Rationale**: Why is this requirement important?
  - **Source**: Which part of the code addresses this requirement?  

For all the above points, create a technical documentation in markdown format with mermaid diagrams if needed.

Put this in a specific subfolder in documentation folder based on the module name.

Create or update a DOCUMENTATION_PROCESS.md file with the steps to create the documentation, from this prompt telling which files and folders have been analyzed, used to create the documentation.
